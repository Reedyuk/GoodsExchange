# GoodsExchange

1. This app is a coding exercise for a company that will remain unnamed.
2. Project uses cocoapods
3. I have only produced unit tests for the business logic, no unit tests have been made for visual elements. I tend to feel that's the job of the UI Unit tests. If i had more time i would have created some ui unit tests.
4. I dont beleive in doing half a job, this took me longer than two hours but i had a fairly open weekend :)

# TODO

1. UI Unit tests to test the cells display.
2. A nicer checkout screen
3. Tool tips to make the user aware that swiping a cell on the product screen removes items
4. A nicer formatted currency screen.
